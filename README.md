## What's Inside (Your New Security Toolkit!)

### üîç **siem_alert_triage.py**
Transform alert chaos into organized action! This friendly script cuts through the noise so you can focus on threats that actually matter.

**Quick Start (seriously, it's this easy!):**
```bash
# Get started in 30 seconds
python siem_alert_triage.py

# With your own configuration (we'll help you set this up!)

```

**Real-world magic:**
```python
# Watch this script turn 127 overwhelming alerts into 3 actionable tickets
# Your future self will thank you! üéØ
alerts = fetch_high_priority_alerts()

## üéØ Real-World Use Cases (See Yourself in These Stories!)

### **Use Case 1: Overwhelmed SOC Analyst**
**The Challenge:** Sarah, a SOC analyst at a mid-size company, starts each day facing 200+ SIEM alerts. Most are false positives, but finding the real threats takes 2-3 hours every morning.

**The Solution:** Using our SIEM alert triage script
```bash
python examples/siem_splunk.py --config production.json
```

**The Result:** Sarah now reviews just 5-8 high-quality tickets instead of 200+ raw alerts. Her morning routine went from stressful to manageable, and she can focus on real security work.

```bash
./examples/compliance_enhanced.sh hipaa
```
