# Enhanced Incident Response Runbook Generator
# 
# This example extends the basic runbook generator with:
# - Custom incident types for your organization
# - Detailed response procedures
# - Contact information and escalation paths
# - Integration points for SIEM/ticketing systems

## üìã Overview

{4}

### When to Use This Runbook
- [List specific triggers and scenarios]
- [Include SIEM alert conditions]
- [Reference specific detection signatures]

---

## üö® Immediate Response (First 5 Minutes)

### 1. Alert Verification
- [ ] Confirm the alert is legitimate (not a false positive)
- [ ] Document initial findings in incident ticket
- [ ] Notify Security Operations Manager if severity is High/Critical

### 2. Initial Containment
- [ ] Isolate affected systems if safe to do so
- [ ] Preserve evidence (avoid powering down systems)
- [ ] Begin timeline documentation

### 3. Communication
- [ ] Create incident ticket in [TICKET_SYSTEM]
- [ ] Notify stakeholders per escalation matrix
- [ ] Prepare initial status update

---

## üîç Detection & Analysis

### Evidence Collection
- [ ] Collect system logs from affected machines
  ```bash
  # Linux systems
  sudo journalctl --since "1 hour ago" > /tmp/system_logs.txt
  
  # Windows systems
  Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{{LogName='System','Application','Security'; StartTime=(Get-Date).AddHours(-1)}} | Export-Csv -Path C:\temp\windows_logs.csv
  ```

- [ ] Network traffic analysis
  ```bash
  # Capture network traffic (if safe)
  tcpdump -i any -w /tmp/incident_capture.pcap
  ```

- [ ] Memory dump (if required)
- [ ] Disk imaging (if required)

### SIEM Queries
```sql
-- Example Splunk query for this incident type
index=security sourcetype=*
| search [RELEVANT_SEARCH_TERMS]
| eval incident_id="{5}"
| table _time, src_ip, dest_ip, action, signature
```

### IOC Analysis
- [ ] Check IOCs against threat intelligence feeds
- [ ] Correlate with historical incidents
- [ ] Update IOC database with new findings

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Containment Strategy

### Short-term Containment
- [ ] Network isolation of affected systems
- [ ] Disable compromised user accounts
- [ ] Block malicious IP addresses/domains
- [ ] Apply emergency patches if applicable

### Long-term Containment
- [ ] Implement additional monitoring
- [ ] Deploy compensating controls
- [ ] Update security policies
- [ ] Schedule system rebuilds if necessary

---

## üßπ Eradication & Recovery

### Eradication Steps
1. [ ] Remove malware/malicious files
2. [ ] Close attack vectors
3. [ ] Update system configurations
4. [ ] Patch vulnerabilities
5. [ ] Reset compromised credentials

### Recovery Process
1. [ ] Restore systems from clean backups
2. [ ] Verify system integrity
3. [ ] Gradually restore network connectivity
4. [ ] Monitor for signs of reinfection
5. [ ] Update security tools and signatures

### Validation
- [ ] Vulnerability scans completed
- [ ] Penetration testing (if required)
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] Security control verification
